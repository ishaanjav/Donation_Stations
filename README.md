Annually, restaurants waste over 1/2 billion tons of food while nearly a billion people don't have access. 

[**Donation Stations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO3fDi2I73Y) is the solution to both problems of food wastage and distribution.
It is a mobile application that allows restaurants to reach out to homeless shelters (and vice versa) to donate any leftover  or uneaten food. 

Via Donation Stations, shelters can contact potential donors through an informative search experience with detailed 
information available about each restaurant and seamless donor-recipient communication within the app itself. They can then 
receive directions to travel to the restaurant to collect their donation. 

**Donation Stations can help stop food wastage by providing food to the millions of people who do not have it.**
